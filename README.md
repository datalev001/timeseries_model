# Time Series Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of SARIMAX, RNN, LSTM, Prophet, and Transformer Models
Assessing the Efficiency and Efficacy of Leading Forecasting Algorithms Across Diverse Datasets
Time series forecasting predicts future events based on past patterns. Our goal is to identify the best prediction methods, as different techniques excel under specific conditions. This post examines how various methods perform on different datasets, offering insights into choosing and fine-tuning the right forecasting method for any scenario.

We'll explore five key methods:

•	SARIMAX: Detects recurring patterns and accounts for various external influences.
•	RNN: Analyzes sequential data, ideal for chronological information.
•	LSTM: Enhances RNNs by retaining data over extended periods.
•	Prophet: Developed by Facebook, robust against data gaps and significant trend shifts.
•	Transformer: Utilizes self-attention to identify intricate patterns effectively.

We put these methods to the test on different kinds of data:
•	Electric Production: Analyzing industry energy consumption trends over time. Kaggle Dataset
•	Sales-of-Shampoo: Monitoring changes in shampoo sales. Kaggle Dataset
•	Crime Data: Offering insights into public safety and urban life. Data.gov Dataset
•	Crash Reporting: Enhancing understanding of car accidents and road safety. Data.gov Dataset
•	Simulation Data: Utilizing a custom-generated time series for an in-depth comparison between RNN and LSTM models.

We're using these models, each set up with carefully chosen settings, on a range of data to see how precise, reliable, and fast they are.
